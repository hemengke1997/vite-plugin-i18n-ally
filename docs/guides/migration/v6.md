# v6 Breaking Changes

## vite-plugin-i18n-ally/client

1. `i18nAlly` is now a class and renamed to `I18nAllyClient`, instead of being a function. You need to use `new` to create an instance.
2. `allLanguages`/`allNamespaces` have been renamed to `supportedLngs`/`supportedNs`.
3. `onInit` has been renamed to `onBeforeInit`.
4. `language`/`languages` have been renamed to `lng`/`lngs`.
5. `namespace`/`namespaces` have been renamed to `ns`.
6. `getLanguages`/`getNamespaces` have been renamed to `getSupportedLngs`/`getSupportedNs`.

The naming conventions are now aligned with `i18next` for better compatibility.

## vite-plugin-i18n-ally/server

This is a new feature in v6 that supports using `i18n-ally` on the server to fetch internationalization resources, and provides language detection based on `request cookie`.
